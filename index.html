            interviewers for this opportunity. She was the first female interviewer I have ever had.
        Her interview question was unique and fun, and she was so lively to talk to! She was a
        huge encouragement to me as a fellow woman in computer science. I am so glad to be
        interviewed by her regardless of the results, I thought at the time.  -->
            I'll be doing backend development for the first time! I'm glad that I'll be trying out something
            new this coming summer, and I've been introducing myself to more backend dev before the
            semester starts in order to prepare.

          <h2>Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Research</h2>
          <h3 class="date">January 2020</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description" id="research-description">
          <p>Towards the end of last fall semester, I looked into Human Computer Interaction
            research at Cornell, coming into to contact with a couple professors who are gracious
            to take me in. I thought I didn't like school so I fervently denied considering grad
            school for 2 years. But, I recently have started questioning whether undergrad is enough.
            Grades alone have become less of a motivation for me to learn, which has been helpful
            and hurtful. What I want is to work with people again like I did during my
            internship last summer. I want to work on things that means more than just a grade. I'm
            looking forward to doing research this coming spring semester! Hopefully, I'll choose
            a professor and project soon!

        <p>This was my first internship! I was on the Guest-Checkout team, and I mainly did
          frontend web development work using JavaScript with React, Redux, and Emotion. I also
          expanded on the GraphQL server to support my features. My main project was expanding
          the new Checkout Lite app to additional markets by building the Know Your Customer
          fields. On top of that, I built out billing and shipping country selection support for
          Inline Guest Checkout.</p>

        <p>The final project for my Embedded Systems class was open ended and only required that
          we wrote in C and that it reflected some of the class material. My partner Jonathan
          Moon and I implemented an air guitar that generates PWM sound waves to pitches according
          to buttons pressed and if strum is sensed. I was really tough getting started since we
          both hardly had any hardware experience. We started the project the earliest, and our
          first question was asking how to use resistors on the breadboard.

        <p>Call For Code is a hackathon for natural disaster prepardness. My team and I

        <p>My interest in coding was kickstarted by my sister-in-law when she taught me how to
          make CSS art on Codepen my freshman year over winter break. I was hooked! I made as
          many as I could before going back to school. Never would have never have imagined
          my first pen being featured on Codepen's Februrary newsletter. I was overwhelmed when
          I first found out. I felt so supported though I was a freshman girl just getting started.
