    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>I am a junior at Cornell University studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering. I only just entered
      the field, but I am excited to begin my journey as a woman in computer science!
      Right now, I do not have a clear picture of what I want to pursue after graduation. Computer Science is such a
      broad term since there are so many fields closely tied to Computer Science. However, I aspire to be like the
      passionate people in my family, especially my sister-in-law Cassidy Williams. My greatest hope is that regardless
      of my passion, I will be confident enough in my field to love what I do and be able to make a difference in
      people.

      As of now, I am interested in exploring UI and app development. I am still very open to learning other ways to
      apply computer science, especially in other fields such as medicine and education.

      I am goofy and naive, and I love sharing jokes, funny stories, or gems of obscure facts. I may be small, but my
      personality is full of energy. On Friday nights, I will be lip-syncing Disney and Weezer songs, playing board
      games, or rock climbing with friends. </p>

    <h1>UPCOMING</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Google Summer 2020 Internship</h2>
      <p>I'm excited to say that I will working for Google this coming summer! I'll be in Bellevue,
        Washington on the Chrome OS Enterprise team. I'm especially so thankful to one of my
        interviewers for this opportunity.
        <!-- She was the first female interviewer I have ever had.
        Her interview question was unique and fun, and she was so lively to talk to! She was a
        huge encouragement to me as a fellow woman in computer science. I am so glad to be
        interviewed by her regardless of the results, I thought at the time.  -->
        I'll
        be doing backend development for the first time! I'm glad that I'll be trying out something
        new this coming summer, and I've been introducing myself to more backend dev before the
        semester starts in order to prepare.

      <h2>Starting HCI Research</h2>
      <p>Towards the end of last fall semester, I looked into Human Computer Interaction
        research at Cornell, coming into to contact with a couple professors who are gracious
        to take me in. I thought I didn't like school so I fervently denied considering grad
        school for 2 years. But, I recently have started questioning whether undergrad is enough.
        Grades alone have become less of a motivation for me to learn, which has been helpful
        and hurtful. What I want is to work with people again like I did during my
        internship last summer. I want to work on things that means more than just a grade. I'm
        looking forward to doing research this coming spring semester! Hopefully, I'll choose
        a professor and project soon!

    <h1>PAST XP</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>PayPal Summer 2019 Internship</h2>
      <p>This was my first internship! I was on the Guest-Checkout team, and I mainly did
        frontend web development work using JavaScript with React, Redux, and Emotion. I also
        expanded on the GraphQL server to support my features. My main project was expanding
        the new Checkout Lite app to additional markets by building the Know Your Customer
        fields. On top of that, I built out billing and shipping country selection support for
        Inline Guest Checkout.</p>

    <h1>THINGS I'M PROUD OF</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Top 10 Project in Embedded Systems</h2>
      <h3>May 2019</h3>
      <p>The final project for my Embedded Systems class was open ended and only required that
        we wrote in C and that it reflected some of the class material. My partner Jonathan
        Moon and I implemented an air guitar that generates PWM sound waves to pitches according
        to buttons pressed and if strum is sensed. I was really tough getting started since we
        both hardly had any hardware experience. We started the project the earliest, and our
        first question was asking how to use resistors on the breadboard.

      <h2>2nd place in Call For Code Hackathon</h2>
      <h3>Sept 2018</h3>
      <p>Call For Code is a hackathon for natural disaster prepardness. My team and I
        designed a centralized communication tool for victims and rescuers in the event of
        a natural disaster that doubles as a weather app for Kenya users.

      <h2>Featured on Codepen</h2>
      <h3>Feb 2018</h3>
      <p>My interest in coding was kickstarted by my sister-in-law when she taught me how to
        make CSS art on Codepen my freshman year over winter break. I was hooked! I made as
        many as I could before going back to school. Never would have never have imagined
        my first pen being featured on Codepen's Februrary newsletter. I was overwhelmed when
        I first found out. I felt so supported though I was a freshman girl just getting started.
