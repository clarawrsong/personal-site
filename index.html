        <p class="about-text" id="dream-text">I spent my first year at Cornell University slowly building confidence to
          major in
          computer science, and a
          second year wrestling my insecurities in my classes and grades. Seeing only intelligent, ambitious people in
          the major, I thought I couldn’t compete as a girl who was still unsure of the future. During my first taste of
          industry the summer after sophomore year, I realized there was so much more to computer science than what my
          classes taught. I was inspired and supported by people to dream more about the things that I could do. Now, in
          my third year at Cornell, I am starting to explore and dream more of what I can do with computer science. My
          greatest hope is that regardless of where life takes me, I will be confident enough in my field to love what I
          do and be able to make a difference in people.</p>

          <p class="about">
            As of now, I want to explore technologies that will equip me for real world application that help people. I
            took a course on Machine Learning last fall, and I’m excited to take a course on Computer Vision this
            spring. I’m hoping to apply what I learn from these classes through research or small projects. I want to
            learn how computer science is being used in areas such as agriculture, sustainability, and human computer
            interaction.

        <p>I'm excited to say that I will working for Google this coming summer! I'll be in Bellevue, Washington on the
          Chrome OS Enterprise team. I'll be doing backend development for the first time! I'm glad that I'll be trying
          out something new, and I've been introducing myself to more backend development before the spring semester
          starts to prepare myself for the summer.

        </div>
        <p>Towards the end of last fall semester, I looked into Human Computer Interaction research at Cornell, coming
          into to contact with a couple professors who are gracious to take me in. Previously, I thought I didn't like
          school so I fervently denied considering grad school for the last 2 years. But, I recently have started
          questioning whether undergrad is enough. I realize I am not satisfied with the application in my classes
          alone, but I want to touch upon technologies like Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I want to work as a
          team with passionate people like I did during my internship last summer. I want to work on things that are
          more meaningful than grades. I'm looking forward to doing research this coming spring semester! I hope to
          choose a professor and project where I can explore and learn the most.

        </div>
        <p>This was my first internship! I was on the Guest-Checkout team, and I mainly did frontend web development
          work using JavaScript with React, Redux, and Emotion. I also expanded on the GraphQL server to support my
          features. My main project was expanding the new Checkout Lite app to additional markets by building the Know
          Your Customer fields. On top of that, I built out billing and shipping country selection support for Inline
          Guest Checkout. I learned how a team works in real life: how much energy is put into writing readable and
          long-lasting code, how any doubt or questions are immediately approached to the appropriate people, and how
          everyone is responsible for checking and double-checking each other’s work.

        </div>
        <p>The final project for my Embedded Systems class was open ended and only required that we wrote in C and that
          it reflected some of the class material. My partner Jonathan Moon and I implemented an air guitar that
          generates PWM sound waves to pitches according to buttons pressed and if strum is sensed. It was really tough
          getting started since we both hardly had any hardware experience. Starting the project the earliest, our first
          question was asking how to use resistors on the breadboard. From there, we had fun getting closer to our
          teaching assistants, tinkering with our hardware components, and practicing Nintendo songs on our finished
          product for the final presentation video.

        <p>Call For Code is a hackathon for natural disaster prepardness. My team and I designed a centralized
          communication tool for victims and rescuers in the event of a natural disaster that doubles as a weather app
          for Kenya users. Though I was the only CS major on my team, we were fueled by a teammate’s passion for his
          country.

        <p>My interest in coding was kickstarted by my sister-in-law when she taught me how to make CSS art on Codepen
          my freshman year over winter break. I was hooked! I made as many as I could before going back to school. Never
          would I have imagined my <a class="inline-link" href="https://codepen.io/clarawrsong/pen/dJOMZa"
            target="_blank">first pen</a> being featured on
          <a class="inline-link" href="https://codepen.io/spark/62" target="_blank">Codepen's weekly newsletter</a>. I
          felt so supported in my journey in computer science though I was just getting started.
